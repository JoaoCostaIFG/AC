# FEUP AC 2022 - G26 Project

Data mining project (machine learning model) for loan status prediction. Status
is whether the loan will be paid or not (profitable opportunity for the bank).

**Grade:** 17

**Note for people in next years:** this class is really hard, because the
projects are evaluated very arbitrarly and the coordinator teacher isn't easy to
deal with.
